# FriendFinder
## Using this application.
### This friend findes app is intended to be a fun test based on the ficitonal Voigt-Kampff test from the Blade Runner movie series to determine who your new friend ought to be.
### Users are directed to the home page with a very basic title screen and the option to continue on to take the test.  There are also links available to view the master API list of other users who have taken the quiz.
### When choosing to take the quiz, the client is directed to the "/survey" page where they are prompted to supply their name, a photo, and answer 10 abstract questions about their ability to detect empathy.  If they successfully respond to all of these options, they will be matched up with the closest similar user as their new best friend.
## Left to do.
### As this was a difficult assignment for me to get to functino properly, there is still work left to do.  
* It is necessary to fix the underlying bug that prevents images and names of the closest match from attaching.  I suspect this is due to an error located in the apiRouthes.js but I have not been able to find the cause yet.  That will be important to make it fully functional.
* CSS should be incorporated to make the image appear within the alert window in a consistent way, and to beautify the survey itself.
* Thematic elements from bootstrap should also be expanded on to make the site look more compelling.
